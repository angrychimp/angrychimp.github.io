## About

Hey, I’m Randy Kahler. I’m a full-stack web engineer living in San Diego and working for [Cordial](https://cordial.com). I'm a site reliability engineer – automating infrastructure monitoring and incident response to ensure optimal site performance and uptime. It's a fancy way of saying I make sure things don't break.

When I’m not hacking away at cloud services, I’m typically outdoors my family, playing video games, reading, or trying to reverse engineer how my wife organizes her closet.

I’m an avid collector of DVDs that I watch once and then just store on my shelves where they are able to themselves collect dust. I’m not sure what the dust collects, but I like to imagine that perhaps they collect atomic civilizations that are microscopic replicas of our own universe, just because that would mean there’s a subatomic version of me that is collecting DVDs that are also collecting sub-subatomic dust, thus creating an infinitely recursive set of collector collections. I like to imagine this because it give my friends migraines.

I’m married to a genuine California girl (living the dream!) and we have an annoyingly cute Beagle/Pug mix, as well an obstinate French Bulldog. We spend our nights Netflixing (which ought to be a verb by now… and I’m looking at you, Oxford people) and praying that our two young boys won’t permanently injure themselves at the local skate park. Feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/angrychimp), and prepare to be underwhelmed by my musings.
